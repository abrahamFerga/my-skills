# providers.tf
#
# Pins Terraform + the azurerm provider and configures provider auth.
#
# Auth model:
#   - In GitHub Actions, authentication is via OIDC / Workload Identity
#     Federation. azure/login@v2 logs in first, and the azurerm provider then
#     reuses that login because `use_oidc = true` plus the ARM_* env vars
#     (ARM_CLIENT_ID / ARM_TENANT_ID / ARM_SUBSCRIPTION_ID / ARM_USE_OIDC) are
#     exported by the workflow. No client secret is ever stored.
#   - Locally, run `az login` and the provider falls back to Azure CLI auth.
